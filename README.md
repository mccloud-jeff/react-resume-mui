#[React + Material UI Resume](https://react-resume-mui.herokuapp.com/)

A deliberately over-engineered web application for displaying my Resume/CV. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate a full
stack of some of the technologies that I frequently work with:

UI: ES6/7 JavaScript, React, Redux, Material UI, CSS Modules via SCSS + Webpack  
Data: GraphQL, Apollo  
Server: Node.js, Express, GraphQL  
TDD: Mocha, Chai, Enzyme  
Build: Webpack, Babel, Live Reload  
Optimization: Server side Rendering, Offline support (ServiceWorker Precache)  
Design: Material Design, Atomic Design  

This will be a living document that I update and refactor frequently. It's a reusable framework/template, so you can provide your
own resume in a `your-name.json` file in /src/profiles and view it at http://localhost:3000/your-name
